# Semantic Analyser (SA)

The **Semantic Analyser (SA)** is a web application and API designed to assist with the semantic analysis and brokerage of data and metadata records targeted for **DCAT-FE harmonisation**.  

It allows users to:

- **Identify** terms used by different RIs for, in a first instance, parameters, instruments, and platforms — either in keyword fields or in specific metadata fields.  
- **Find** possible matches with known semantic resources curated in the SA Knowledge Base.  
- **Obtain** unique URIs for terms when these are missing, enabling unambiguous identification of semantic elements.  
- **Suggest** mappings to URIs from the targeted reference list of vocabularies identified in *D2.3*, enabling harmonisation on a subset of common vocabularies.
