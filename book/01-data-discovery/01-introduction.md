# Introduction
One part of the FE framework is the **Interdisciplinary Data Discovery and Access Service** (IDDAS) that helps users find and access various types of data sets (like e.g. in situ, satellite, model outputs) from existing environmental data sources. This service makes it possible to share and use data across different fields and connect with the FE Earth Analytics Lab (EAL) for analysis and visualisation. The IDDAS approach documents new recommended practices and demonstrates its added value.

The final release of the FE IDDAS, consists of a DCAT-FE target metadata model, a search User Interface (UI),  SPARQL API and VRE widget for machine-to-machine access. It focuses on providing a semantically enriched metadata catalogue based on
a customised DCAT application profile (DCAT-FE), enabling seamless data discovery and access across domains and platforms, both for human and machine.
