# Interactive notebooks

Interactive notebooks offer a flexible environment for combining code,
text, and visualisations, making them a widely used tool for exploratory
data analysis and reproducible research. Within FAIR-EASE, two platforms
are supported:

- JupyterLab, mainly used by data scientists, which is compatible with
  numerous languages (e.g. Python, R, Julia) and provide a lot of
  extensions ;

- Pluto.jl, dedicated for Julia programmers, which provides a reactive
  environment.

A special focus is placed on JupyterGIS, a new approach for
collaborative geospatial analysis within notebooks. It combines the
flexibility of Jupyter with tools tailored for GIS operations and
visualisation, enabling users to explore spatial data, apply processing
functions, and share results, all within a unified interface designed
for collaborative use.
