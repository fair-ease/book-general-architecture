Based on a \"system of systems\" approach, FAIR-EASE allows for
interconnecting three EAL implementations through federated
capabilities, enabling users to seamlessly move from one EAL to another
and to access and use the available computing services and resources,
which may differ between EALs.

We will present these three EALs, including FAIR-EASE contributions,
followed by an analysis of their strengths as well as areas for
improvement.
