# Data access

The FAIR-EASE project explored both server-side mechanisms, which aim to
improve performance, scalability and interoperability in heterogeneous
data infrastructures, and client-side usage, which focus on simplifying
data access for users, particularly those without in-depth technical
expertise, but also the robustness of applications over time.

By taking these two perspectives into account, the project ensures that
data can be accessed smoothly, efficiently and transparently, whether
through automated workflows or user-friendly interfaces tailored to real
scientific use cases.

For the server-side part we evaluated four technical solutions: S3 /
ARCO combination for serverless and cloud-ready subsetting, STAC /
OpenEO combination for unified data access and remote process on
datacubes, Beacon for efficient data access and data harmonisation
capabilities, and Apache Iceberg for managing large-scale tabular data.
